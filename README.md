# Hello there! üëãüèº

### I'm Alexandra and I love building amazing software, nice to meet you! Let me introduce myself further. 

#### I'm an ambitious person and a problem solver who loves a good challenge. I like to build things from the ground up and I believe that if you keep going, in spite of all the obstacles, you can achieve anything. My favourite quote is "Aim for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll be among the stars" because it's a reminder of the fact that even if you don't achieve your goals, you have come a long way.

#### I am a responsible person and I take accountability for my work. I own both my successes and my mistakes. I thrive when I understand what is the big picture and when I can clearly see the final result in my head. I need to know all the variables in order to come up with the best battle plan. I love working with passionate, proactive people who are looking for ways to use their skills in order to make a positive impact on the world around them. 

#### I've worked on projects ranging from apps to websites to internal company tools, and every project has taught me something new. During these project, I worked with my team and I made a priority of creating an environment where people feel safe to fail, learn from their mistakes, develop both professionally and personally and explore new ideas. At the same time, I did technical work and I struggled to write and review code that met the highest industry standards in terms of readability and efficiency. On top of that, I always stayed up to date with the latest software development trends and technologies by reading articles and taking online courses.

#### My vision is that technology should help and liberate people, empower them and improve their lives.  I also believe that people can build amazing things when they have the right tools and support. Real progress lies at the intersection of humans and technology.  I am proud to be contributing to this progress.
